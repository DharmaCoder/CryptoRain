This is a set of skins for Rainmeter that allows the user to track the price of alt-coins, as well as keep track of the value of their portfolio. This skin was developed based on the Geo.Crypto skin (http://bit.ly/GeoCrypto) - Forked for easily adding coins to be represented in US Dollar amount.

How does it work?

On the @resources folder you'll find an .inc file where you can change the URLs for the alt-coins you wish to track. Please refer to the coinmarketcap API to find which alt-coins you want to track. By default the skin is tracking BTC, ETH, LTC, and DASH. 

Some changes have to be made if you choose other currencies on the .ini files that you can find, namely the label for the coin.

The Portfolio .ini files allows you to place the amount of currency you have, as well as the average price that you bought, to calculate the profit margin to date.
